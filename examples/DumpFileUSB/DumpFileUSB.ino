/*
  MSC USB Drive file dump
 
 This example shows how to read a file from the SD card using the
 SD library and send it over the serial port.
 	
 The circuit:
 * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
 ** MOSI - pin 11, pin 7 on Teensy with audio board
 ** MISO - pin 12
 ** CLK - pin 13, pin 14 on Teensy with audio board
 ** CS - pin 4, pin 10 on Teensy with audio board

// Setup MSC for the number of USB Drives you are using. (Two for this example)
// Mutiple  USB drives can be used. Hot plugging is supported. There is a slight
// delay after a USB MSC device is plugged in. This is waiting for initialization
// but after it is initialized ther should be no delay.

// On the Ethernet Shield, CS is pin 4. Note that even if it's not
// used as the CS pin, the hardware CS pin (10 on most Arduino boards,
// 53 on the Mega) must be left as an output or the SD library
// functions will not work.

// change this to match your SD shield or module;
// Arduino Ethernet shield: pin 4
// Adafruit SD shields and modules: pin 10
// Sparkfun SD shield: pin 8
// Teensy audio board: pin 10
// Teensy 3.5 & 3.6 & 4.1 on-board: BUILTIN_SDCARD

// Teensy 2.0: pin 0
